\section{Introduction}
In the beginning, one of the projects that took part was developing the landing page for Affilater Hoslog at Global Square IT Company. So, my major objective was going to convert the predefined Figma design into a visually fully functional website. The landing page was developed using React.js and vanilla CSS, paying close attention to responsive layouts and mobile compatibility through CSS media queries. This helped me have real exposure to translating design specifications into a dynamic and interactive user interface.

Another important project was the creation of a landing page for Square Japan. More precisely, it included interactive features that served as a recruitment page and inquiry form. The Next.js library was applied to build a landing page with Tailwind CSS styling that kept the views consistent, maintainable, and responsive.

Contributed to the full-featured, collaborative e-commerce application. This included responsibilities such as designing and implementing the front-end UI for both customer and admin portals. Admin side comprises a dashboard developed along with a sidebar and data visualization charts using Recharts for actionable insights; on the client side, key pages such as login page, product listing pages were developed.

\section{Problem Statement}
With the increasing demand for seamless online experiences, organizations need web applications that are both visually attractive and functionally robust. Frontend development involves several difficulties, such as converting design mockups into functional interfaces, managing dynamic data, ensuring cross-device compatibility, and maintaining code quality for long-term scalability. The internship mainly focused on addressing these challenges by working on real-world projects, implementing features like authentication, dynamic product displays, responsive layouts, and interactive components, thereby bridging the gap between academic learning and practical frontend development experience.

\section{Objective}
The goals of the internship  were as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item To follow the industry's best practices in front-end development by writing clean, modular, and maintainable code, performing UI testing, and using version control tools to support collaboration
    \item To integrate frontend components with backend services, implement dynamic features, and enhance application performance, usability, and maintainability through real-world project development.
\end{itemize}

\section{Scope and Limitations}
\subsection{Scope}
The scope of the E-commerce web application developed during the internship includes the following:


\begin{itemize}
\item The internship involved creating front-end interfaces for various web applications, including landing pages and e-commerce platforms, utilizing modern technologies such as React.js, Next.js, CSS, and Tailwind CSS.

\item The work emphasized responsive design, user experience, integration with backend APIs, and development of dynamic features to improve functionality and interactivity.

\end{itemize}
\subsection{Limitations}
Despite its functionality and practical implementation, the E-commerce web application developed during the internship faces the following technical and operational limitations:

\begin{itemize}
    
\item The internship was mainly centered on frontend development, providing limited experience with advanced backend processes, database management, and server-side optimization.

\item Certain projects were restricted by predefined designs, tight deadlines, and dependency on backend-developed APIs, which constrained full end-to-end control over the system.

\end{itemize}

\section{Report Organization}
The report is organized in the systematic pattern where each chapter includes the subtopics to support the main title of the report. The report is organized as follows: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Chapter 1: Introduction} \\
    The chapter initiates with the introduction of the whole report, systematically partitioned into four distinct subchapters. It includes introduction of the internship project, problem statement, objectives, scope and limitation. 

    \item \textbf{Chapter 2: Organizational Review and Literature Review} \\
    This chapter offers a concise overview of organization involved in the project and includes a review of relevant literature related to the project's domain.
