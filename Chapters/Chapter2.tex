\section{Literature Review}
Modern web applications heavily rely on the fundamental principles of JavaScript, particularly asynchronous programming, execution contexts, and event-driven architectures. Resources like W3Schools and JavaScript.info provide comprehensive explanations of these concepts, covering topics such as promises, async/await patterns, closures, and the call stack. Understanding these fundamentals is critical for handling complex application behavior, managing concurrent tasks, and ensuring that code execution remains predictable and efficient. Mastery of these concepts forms the foundation for integrating advanced frameworks and libraries while adhering to modern ECMAScript standards, allowing developers to build robust, high-performance applications.\textcite{javascript_info}\textcite{w3schools_js}

Managing data effectively is a key challenge in modern web development. TanStack Query addresses this by providing a server-state management solution that eliminates much of the manual client-side state tracking. Unlike traditional state management approaches, which often require repetitive boilerplate code for fetching, caching, and updating data, TanStack Query automates these processes. It offers built-in caching strategies, background data synchronization, and query invalidation, ensuring that the user interface always reflects the most up-to-date server state. By shifting the focus from local state management to server-driven state, applications can achieve improved performance, consistency, and maintainability.\textcite{tanstack_query}

Effective routing is essential for building dynamic, single-page applications. TanStack Router enhances traditional routing by treating the URL as the primary source of truth, enabling type-safe state management and predictable navigation flows. This approach allows for consistent and bookmarkable application states, while ensuring that each page or component has access to the required data and parameters. TanStack Router integrates closely with server-state management tools, enabling developers to synchronize route transitions with data fetching and validation. As a result, applications built with this architecture maintain both functional consistency and a smooth user experience across complex navigation scenarios.\textcite{tanstack_router}

Ensuring data correctness is a critical aspect of web application reliability. Zod is a TypeScript-first schema validation library that provides runtime validation of data structures. It allows developers to define strict schemas for API responses, form inputs, and application state, automatically catching errors before they propagate through the system. Zod’s seamless integration with TypeScript also enables strong type inference, reducing the likelihood of runtime errors and improving code safety. By validating data at the boundaries of the system, applications can maintain integrity, prevent unexpected crashes, and provide more reliable user experiences.\textcite{zod_dev}

Presenting complex datasets in a clear and efficient manner is a common requirement for web applications. TanStack Table implements a “headless” architecture, separating data-handling logic from visual presentation. This approach allows developers to implement features such as sorting, filtering, grouping, and pagination without imposing any constraints on the UI design. By decoupling logic from interface, TanStack Table enables high-performance data handling while maintaining complete control over the look and feel of the application. This separation promotes modularity, simplifies testing, and improves maintainability for data-intensive applications.\textcite{tanstack_table}
Modern UI development often requires reusable, consistent, and customizable components. Shadcn provides a modular component library designed to integrate seamlessly with modern frameworks while allowing full control over styling and behavior. Its component-driven architecture enables developers to build scalable interfaces, maintain design consistency, and quickly adapt to evolving project requirements. By combining modular UI components with headless libraries for logic, applications achieve both high usability and maintainability, while reducing development time and improving the overall quality of the user interface.\textcite{shadcn_ui}
